# This config file is used to configure the logging of MAST. There are several
# options which can be changed to suit your needs. What follows is a
# description of each.
#
# There is one section in this file, [logging], which is used to configure
# all the options of MAST logging. The following are the options you can
# configure:
#
# * level - The level of logging 1-100, the lower the number, the more
# verbose the logging (note that this is usually set in increments of ten
# and you may not notice any difference otherwise ie. between 10 and 11
# there will be no difference in your logs)
# * rolling_unit - The unit of time in which logs are rolled. You have the
# following options: S, M, H, D (meaning seconds, minutes, hours and days
# respectively)
# * rolling_interval - The number of units (defined above) after which to roll
# the log files. For instance, if rolling_unit is H and interval is 1 then
# the logs will roll every hour.
# * propagage - Whether to pass messages to parent loggers (as defined by
# a dot-notation heirarchy)
# * backup_count - The number of rolled log files to keep
