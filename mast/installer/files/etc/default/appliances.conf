# and option values are case-sensitive
#
# This file is used to configure any custom settings needed in order to
# interact with an appliance.
#
# There are 6 attributes you can specify for any one appliance:
#
#     * soma_port - The port to connect to the SOMA xml management
#     interface (default is 5550)
#
#     * web_port - The port for the DataPower Web GUI (default is 9090)
#
#     * ssh_port - The port to connect to the ssh interface
#     (default is 22)
#
#     * soma_scheme - The scheme used to connect to the xml management
#     interface (either http or https) (the default is https)
#
#     * soma_uri - The uri to use for the SOMA interface (defaults to
#     "/service/mgmt/current")
#
#     * soma_spec_file - The spec file to use for the applicable version
#     of the DataPower firmware (default is "etc/xi52soma.xml") Please
#     contact McIndi at briankearney@mcindi.com if you need help with
#     this file
#
#     * retry_interval - If a positive number, MAST will attempt to retry
#       a request if an exception was raised while sending a request to the
#       XML Management Interface. A negitive value or zero will cause MAST to
#       not retry.
#
#     * check_hostname - If False, hostname verification will be turned off
#       for TLS connections to the appliance. **Important** If specified in
#       this config it will override any options passed to the command line
#       concerning hostname verification.
#
# Stanzas:
#
# stanzas should only define the options you wish to specify. There is
# no added value in putting all of the defaults in the stanza.
#
# Stanzas should follow the following format:
#
# [hostname/ip]
# soma_port: 5550
# web_port: 9090
# ssh_port: 22
# soma_scheme: https
# soma_uri: /service/mgmt/current
# soma_spec_file: etc/xi52soma.xml
# retry_interval: 0
#
# **Important**: if you have an alias configured for an appliance
#           in hosts.conf, you must specify the alias here as the
#           hostname/ip for it to work when using the alias. If you
#           want to be able to use both the ip and the alias then
#           you will need two stanzas here.
#
# The Global Stanza:
#
# You can specify global settings which will apply to every appliance unless
# overidden by an appliance-specific stanza. The same options are available
# in the global config as in the appliance-specific configuration.
