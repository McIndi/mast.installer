# **IMPORTANT**: Do not modify this file! Instead make your changes in
# MAST_HOME/etc/local/appliances.conf
#
# logging.conf
#
# This is used to configure the logging system for MAST. There are four
# loggers to configure here each with their own stanza, and one additional
# stanza.
#
# [mast]
#
# This is the mast log and only has to do with the mast command line utility.
# This will log what applications were launched and when. It will not log
# any specific details about the appliances affected or their responses.
#
# you have the following options:
#
# log_file - the path and filename of the log file which will be written to
#            by this logger
#
# log_mode - either "a" or "w" if set to "a" then the log file will be appended
#            to, if it is set to "w" then the log file will be written fresh
#            (emptied) each time it is written to
#
# log_level - This is the level (an integer) of verbosity for the logger. The
#             lower the number the more verbose the logging.
#
# console - If true this logger will log to the console as well as to the
#           file.
#
# [application]
#
# This is the application logger. It will log activity of the application
# launched by mast. There will be little activity here as it is being phased
# out in favor of the appliance level loggers.
#
# The options available here are the same as above, except that in the log_file
# option "{}" will be replaced with the name of the application.
#
# [DataPower]
#
# This is a collection of each appliance's log. anything that any utility in
# MAST does to any appliance will be logged here.
#
# You have the same options as in the [mast] section.
#
# [appliance]
#
# This is where events concerning a specific appliance are logged. Anything
# done with MAST to a specific appliance is logged here.
#
# You have the same options here as you do with the above sections, but in the
# log_file option "{}" will be replaced with the appliances hostname.
#
# [from_appliance]
#
# This is not a logger of MAST rather you are able to specify here one option
# which is the default location to store logs retrieved from the appliance.
