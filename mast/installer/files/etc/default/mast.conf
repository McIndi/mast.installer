# There are two stanzas which can be specified here, mast and ssh.
#
# The descriptions are as follows:
#
#    [ssh]
#    auto_add_keys - Whether to automatically add host keys to the list of
#                    known hosts, or to fail if the ssh server's host key is
#                    not trusted.
#
#    timeout - The timeout in seconds before a single command fails

[ssh]
