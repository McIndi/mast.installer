# This is used to specify a few options needed for MAST to function properly
# There are two stanzas which can be specified here, mast and ssh.
#
# The descriptions are as follows:
#
#    [mast]
#    path - a space-seperated list of directories to look in for scripts.
#           if they are relative they are relative to MAST_HOME if they
#           are absolute then they are absolute paths
#
#    [ssh]
#    auto_add_keys - Whether to automatically add host keys to the list of
#                    known hosts, or to fail if the ssh server's host key is
#                    not trusted.
#
#    timeout - The timeout in seconds before a single command fails

[mast]
