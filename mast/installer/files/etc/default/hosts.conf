#
# This is used to assign aliases to your DataPower appliances. There can be
# many reasons you would want to do this for instance you may not have
# any of your DataPower IP Addresses in DNS and you don't want to type
# out their IP all the time, or maybe your company uses hostnames which
# are difficult to remember or very long and you don't want to type them
# out all the time.
#
# You can think of this file as a mini hosts file like the one your
# OS probably provide. This only affects MAST, it will not act as a
# hosts file for your OS.
#
# Stanzas
#
# There is only one stanza in this file and it is formatted like this:
#
# [hosts]
# alias: IP-or-Hostname
#
# where alias is a unique alias used to refer to the specified appliance
# and IP-or-Hostname is either an IP Address of a DataPower appliance
# or a hostname which will resolve in DNS to the IP Address of a
# DataPower appliance.
