# **IMPORTANT**: Do not modify this file! Instead make your changes in
# MAST_HOME/etc/local/environments.conf
#
# environments.conf
#
# This file is used to specify a group of appliances which have an arbitrary
# relationship to each other. The environments defined here can be used
# in place of a hostname or IP in any of the MAST tools to reference all
# of the appliances defined within that environment.
#
# The format of the stanzas here is simple they are in the following
# format:
#
# [environment_name]
# appliances: hostname1 hostname2 hostname3
#
# where the environment_name is a unique name (case counts) used to identify
# the environment, and each hostname is one of the following:
#
#     1. an IP Address of a DataPower
#     2. a hostname which will resolve in DNS to a DataPower appliance
#     3. an alias defined in hosts.conf
#
# A few notes on environments:
#
# environments are a central tennant to MAST. They are one of the founding
# principles meaning they are important. If you find any bugs with our
# implementation, please report them to us immediately.
#
# The use cases we have seen for environments are many and they vary
# dramatically from user to user, but the two most common are:
#
#     1. define a group which contains all of the DataPower appliances
#     on your network.
#
#     2. To define groups based on their role (ie. DEV, QA, UAT, PROD and DR)
#
# While these are the two most common, please use them in any way which will
# benifit you and your network.
