MAST for IBM DataPower

current known issues
Because of a major change in architecture between version 1.x.x and version 2.x.x, we have a number of issues which we are working hard to solve. The most major one is lack of documentation as it all needs to be rewritten, but the built-in help should explain everything and updated manuals are on their way. We expect version 2.0.2 to solve these known issues and to include three more manuals: The MAST Web GUI and The MAST API. Version 2.0.2 is due to be released on October 15, 2015.


As of MAST for IBM DataPower version 2.0.1 we have the following known issues:
1. The MAST Web GUI manual is not finished
2. The MAST API manual is not finished
3. When mastd is running on Windows you will get an error if you try to run a CLI command because mastd will have the log file open. On Linux two processes can have the same file open at the same time.
4. reboot-appliance reboots the appliances in a parallel fashion, this is a bug as it does not adhere to the design specification
5. mast.datapower.deployment doesn’t work from the cli
   1. Because of this a major use-case is not included in the Getting Started manual
